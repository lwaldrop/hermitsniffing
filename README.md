# hermitsniffing
MATLAB code for simulations of odor capture by terrestrial hermit crab with a Markov-chain Monte Carlo model of diffusion and PIV data-based advection. This version of code works on Matlab v.8.3 (R2014a). Modified to run on UNC's Kure cluster. Special thanks to Dennis Evangelista for help with the code.
